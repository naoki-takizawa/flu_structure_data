## introduction
This repository contains bigWig files of influenza A virus (IAV) structure probing data publised in N Takizawa and RK Kawaguchi, Comput Struct Biotechnol J. (2023).
You can view these structure probing data of IAV using genome browser.
Here, I will also show how to view these data locally using JBrowseR.
